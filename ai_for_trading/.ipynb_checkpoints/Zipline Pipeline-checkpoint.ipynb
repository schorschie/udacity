    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "On any given trading day, the entire universe of stocks consists of thousands of securities. Usually, you will not be  interested in investing in all the stocks in the entire universe, but rather, you will likely select only a subset of these to invest. For example, you may only want to invest in stocks that have a 10-day average closing price of \\$10.00 or less. Or you may only want to invest in the top 500 securities ranked by some factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid spending a lot of time doing data wrangling to select only the securities you are interested in, people often use **pipelines**. In general, a pipeline is a placeholder for a series of data operations used to filter and rank data according to some factor or factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to work with the **Zipline Pipeline**. Zipline is an open-source algorithmic trading simulator developed by *Quantopian*. We will learn how to use the Zipline Pipeline to filter stock data according to factors. "

    "# Loading Data with Zipline\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build our pipeline with Zipline, we will first see how we can load the stock data we are going to use into Zipline. Zipline uses **Data Bundles** to make it easy to use different data sources. A data bundle is a collection of pricing data, adjustment data, and an asset database. Zipline employs data bundles to preload data used to run backtests and store data for future runs. Zipline comes with a few data bundles by default but it also has the ability to ingest new bundles. The first step to using a data bundle is to ingest the data. Zipline's ingestion process will start by downloading the data or by loading data files from your local machine. It will then pass the data to a set of writer objects that converts the original data to Zipline’s internal format (`bcolz` for pricing data, and `SQLite` for split/merger/dividend data) that hs been optimized for speed. This new data is written to a standard location that Zipline can find. By default, the new data is written to a subdirectory of `ZIPLINE_ROOT/data/<bundle>`, where `<bundle>` is the name given to the bundle ingested and the subdirectory is named with the current date. This allows Zipline to look at older data and run backtests on older copies of the data. Running a backtest with an old ingestion makes it easier to reproduce backtest results later. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be using stock data from **Quotemedia**. In the Udacity Workspace you will find that the stock data from Quotemedia has already been ingested into Zipline. Therefore, in the code below we will use Zipline's `bundles.load()` function to load our previously ingested stock data from Quotemedia. In order to use the `bundles.load()` function we first need to do a couple of things. First, we need to specify the name of the bundle previously ingested. In this case, the name of the Quotemedia data bundle is `eod-quotemedia`:"

Given a security and a specific moment in time, the most recent price is a number. Another example is the 10-day average trading volume of a security. Factors are most commonly used to assign values to securities which can then be combined with filters or other factors. The fact that you can combine multiple factors makes it easy for you to form new custom factors that can be as complex as you like. For example, constructing a Factor that computes the average of two other Factors can be simply illustrated usingthe pseudocode below:\n",

An example of a filter is a function indicating whether a security's price is below \\$5. Given a security and a specific moment in time, this evaluates to either **True** or **False**. Filters are most commonly used for selecting sets of securities to include or exclude from your stock universe. Filters are usually applied using comparison operators, such as <, <=, !=, ==, >, >=."

    "One of the features of Zipline's Pipeline is that it separates the actual source of the stock data from the abstract description of that dataset. Therefore, Zipline employs **DataSets** and **Loaders** for those datasets. `DataSets` are just abstract collections of sentinel values describing the columns/types for a particular dataset.  While a `loader` is an object which, given a request for a particular chunk of a dataset, can actually get the requested data. For example, the loader used for the `USEquityPricing` dataset, is the `USEquityPricingLoader` class. The `USEquityPricingLoader` class will delegate the loading of baselines and adjustments to lower-level subsystems that know how to get the pricing data in the default formats used by Zipline (`bcolz` for pricing data, and `SQLite` for split/merger/dividend data). As we saw in the beginning of this notebook, data bundles automatically convert the stock data into `bcolz` and `SQLite` formats. It is important to note that the `USEquityPricingLoader` class can also be used to load daily OHLCV data from other datasets, not just from the `USEquityPricing` dataset. Simliarly, it is also  possible to write different loaders for the same dataset and use those instead of the default loader. Zipline contains lots of other loaders to allow you to load data from different datasets.\n",

    "In the code below, we will use `USEquityPricingLoader(BcolzDailyBarWriter, SQLiteAdjustmentWriter)` to create a loader from a `bcolz` equity pricing directory and a `SQLite` adjustments path. Both the `BcolzDailyBarWriter` and `SQLiteAdjustmentWriter` determine the path of the pricing and adjustment data. Since we will be using the Quotemedia data bundle, we will use the `bundle_data.equity_daily_bar_reader` and the `bundle_data.adjustment_reader` as our `BcolzDailyBarWriter` and `SQLiteAdjustmentWriter`, respectively."

The `SimplePipelineEngine(get_loader, calendar, asset_finder)` class associates the chosen data loader with the corresponding dataset and a trading calendar. The `get_loader` parameter must be a callable function that is given a loadable term and returns a `PipelineLoader` to use to retrieve the raw data for that term in the pipeline. In our case, we will be using the `pricing_loader` defined above, we therefore, create a function called `choose_loader` that returns our `pricing_loader`. The function also checks that the data that is being requested corresponds to OHLCV data, otherwise it retunrs an error. The `calendar` parameter must be a `DatetimeIndex` array of dates to consider as trading days when computing a range between a fixed `start_date` and `end_date`. In our case, we will be using the same trading days as those used in the NYSE. We will use Zipline's `get_calendar('NYSE')` function to retrieve the trading days used by the NYSE. We then use the `.all_sessions` attribute to get the `DatetimeIndex` from our `trading_calendar` and pass it to the `calendar` parameter. Finally, the `asset_finder` parameter determines which assets are in the top-level universe of our stock data at any point in time.
